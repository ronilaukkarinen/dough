A self-hosted personal finance dashboard that connects to YNAB and uses Claude AI for financial advice, spending summaries, and debt strategies.

## Why Dough

YNAB is great for detailed per-account envelope budgeting, but it's an individual tool. When you share finances with a partner, you need a shared view that answers simple questions: "how much can we spend today?", "are we on track this month?", "can we afford eating out tonight?"

Dough was built to solve this:

- **Accountless by design** — no separate checking, savings, or credit card views. One household, one balance, one daily budget. Your partner doesn't need to understand account structures or envelope budgeting.
- **Household-first** — all data is shared. Both users see the same dashboard, same AI advisor, same bills and income. No "my budget" vs "your budget."
- **AI that knows your situation** — Claude has full context of your balance, bills, debts, income dates, and spending patterns. Ask "can I buy lunch today?" and get a real answer based on cash flow simulation, not a generic rule.
- **Cash flow simulation** — the daily budget accounts for when income arrives and when bills are due. It knows your tax payment is due the day before salary and doesn't panic about it.
- **Receipt scanning** — snap a photo of a receipt in the chat, the AI reads it and adds the expense to YNAB automatically.
- **Works alongside YNAB** — Dough doesn't replace YNAB's envelope budgeting or bank connections. It's an intelligence layer on top. YNAB handles the accounting, Dough handles the "how are we doing?" question.
- **Self-hosted, private** — your financial data stays on your machine. No cloud services, no third-party access. SQLite database you can back up with a single file copy.

```

## YNAB setup

1. Go to [YNAB Developer Settings](https://app.ynab.com/settings/developer)
2. Create a personal access token
3. Paste it in Dough settings or `.env.local`
4. Select your budget and sync

Dough caches YNAB data locally in SQLite. Syncing is manual (button press) to avoid rate limits. The app works fully offline with cached data.

## AI setup

Dough uses the [Claude CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) for AI features. Install it and make sure `claude` is available in your PATH.

AI features:
- **Chat advisor** with full financial context (balance, transactions, bills, debts, investments, income)
- **Daily summary** with spending analysis and month-end projections
- **Debt payoff suggestions** with strategy recommendations

All AI prompts are editable in Settings. The household profile is injected into every prompt for personalized advice.

## Running as a service

### systemd (Linux)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
```

Create `~/.config/systemd/user/dough.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Dough personal finance app

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/dough
ExecStart=/path/to/node node_modules/.bin/next start -p 3001
Restart=on-failure
Environment=NODE_ENV=production

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now dough
```

### Cloudflare tunnel (optional)

To expose the app over the internet:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel create dough
cloudflared tunnel route dns dough your-domain.example.com
```

Create `~/.cloudflared/config-dough.yml`:

```yaml
tunnel: <tunnel-id>
credentials-file: ~/.cloudflared/<tunnel-id>.json
ingress:
  - hostname: your-domain.example.com
    service: http://localhost:3001
  - service: http_status:404
```

## Backups

The SQLite database is at `data/dough.db`. Back it up regularly:

```bash
sqlite3 data/dough.db ".backup /path/to/backup/dough-$(date +%Y%m%d).db"
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Runs with Turbopack at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Code style

- Custom CSS framework (no Tailwind), classes over inline styles
- Sentence case for headings and commits
- Verbose logging at every step (debug, info, warning, error)
- DRY code, shared utilities extracted
- No emojis in code or commits

### Adding a new page

1. Create the page at `src/app/(app)/your-page/page.tsx`
2. Add the API route at `src/app/api/your-feature/route.ts`
3. Add translations to `src/lib/i18n/en.ts` and `fi.ts`
4. Add sidebar nav item in `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`
5. Use existing CSS classes from `src/styles/modules/pages.css`

### Adding translations

All UI text lives in `src/lib/i18n/en.ts` (English) and `fi.ts` (Finnish). Add keys to both files with matching structure.
